            Prep Time:5 minutes<br/>
            Cook Time:20 minutes<br/>
            Total Time:25 minutes<br/>
            Servings:8<br/>
            Ingredients:<br/>
            1 can of crescent roll dough<br/>
            1/4 cup nutella, or chocolate spread of choice<br/>
            Powdered sugar (optional)<br/>
            Procedure:<br/>
            STEP 1:
Preheat oven to 375ÂºF. Unwrap and roll dough onto a clean surface.<br/>
STEP 2:
Seal perforated edges by gently pinching dough with your fingers.<br/>
STEP 3:
To make spreading easier, microwave Nutella or chocolate spread for 40 seconds, mixing every 20 seconds.<br/>
STEP 4:
Cover entire dough with the melted chocolate spread.<br/>
STEP 5:
Position the dough landscape-wise and roll up the dough tightly. Seal the edges to make sure dough does not unroll.<br/>
STEP 6:
Move rolled up dough to a baking sheet covered with parchment paper. Leaving one centimeter at one end of the roll, use a sharp knife to cut lengthwise down the middle and completely through the other end.<br/>
STEP 7:
Gently rotate each half of the dough away from the center so the inside of the roll is facing upwards. Bring one half over the other.<br/>
STEP 8:
Bring the opposite half over the first half as closely as possible.<br/>
STEP 9:
Repeat steps 7 and 8 until you run out of dough.<br/>
STEP 10:
Seal by pinching the two ends together. Bake for 17 to 20 minutes.<br/>
STEP 11:
Let braided bread cool for 20 minutes.<br/>
STEP 12:
Finish by dusting powdered sugar on top before serving.<br/>
STEP 13:
Enjoy :) (as if we had to tell you).<br/>
