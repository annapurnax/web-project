            Ingredients:<br/>
            2 eggs<br/>
            1/2 cup Nutella (you don’t have to be super precise)<br/>
            Directions:<br/>

1. Pre-heat oven to 375°F.<br/>

2. Put the Nutella in a small bowl.<br/>

3. Separate the eggs, mix the yolks with the Nutella and put the egg whites in a separate bowl.<br/>

4. Whip the egg whites until they hold stiff peaks, but not too much or they will start to separate. You can add a teaspoon of sugar or a pinch of cream of tartar to help stabilize the whites and prevent over-beating.<br/>

5. Mix 1/3 of the whipped egg whites into the Nutella mixture. This is called sacrificing and it lightens the chocolate mixture, making it easier to fold in the rest of the whites<br/>
6. Add the remaining egg whites into the Nutella and gently fold with a spatula until incorporated– it’s ok if there are a few streaks.<br/>
7. Pour the mixture into a buttered ramekin, or oven-safe ceramic mug.<br/>

8. Cook for 15 minutes.<br/>
9. Eat ASAP, with whipped cream<br/>
